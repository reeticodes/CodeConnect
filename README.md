# CODE CONNECT

Various questions can occur to a student on a day to day basis. These doubts can be solved by someone who has already faced these issues. Code Connect provides easy and more accessible opportunities for all the computer department students to interact with each other. It helps students to interact and learn something new amid the crisis.

## Introduction

Code Connect is a web application, **_made for students by students_**. With its easy to use interface, interaction with other students is just a click away. Built on open source softwareâ€™s, Code Connect provides a fast and effortless path for upgradeability.

## Objective

Code Connect expects to provide a common platform for students to interact online for institutional needs.

Students who are new to programming can discuss with seniors who have faced issues with the same.

## Scope

- The scope of the project is the computer department.
- Users can **_create_** and **_customize_** their profiles according to their needs.
- Adding a programming **_skillset_** makes it easier for others to notice and correlate.
- Actions such as **_like_**, **_dislike_**, **_comment_**, and **_follow_** are open for all.
- Administrator specific actions like **_announcements_** are also accessible for specific individuals.
- Show your code from the open-source repositories with your **_GitHub_** username.

## Feasibility Analysis

Code Connect is completely built on **_open source_**, which means it is completely free to use and easy to modify.

In terms of technical feasibility, this project would run on a web server when in production. So, users would be able to access it through any browser which has a **_JavaScript Engine_** and a data plan.

To make the project operational for larger institutions, it would require a more efficient server for faster transfer of data.

## Architecture

To create, build, or maintain the project an efficient environment is required. This project requires **_Node.js_** and its submodules along with external downloadable packages. The frontend is made with **_React by Facebook_** and an extensive backend API with **_Express_**. It includes authorization and authentication with the help of stateless **_JWT_**. **_Redux_** is used for state management and the data is stored in a **_NoSQL_** database, **_MongoDB_**.
